## Questions
#### What is Dragonbot?
Dragonbot is a Discordbot I created. He is kinda dumb sometimes and I am not really planning to do much on that. <br>
I mean, sometimes it is funny that he is so dumb. Well, he just doesn't remember what you said. <br>
So some conversations can be easier than one with Dragonbot. :) <br>
#### Is Dragonbot a good bot?
Well, if you would ask me, yeah. Sure! Of course he is good. <br>
Nah, I don't think Dragonbot is outstanding. He 'just works'. <br>
Maybe I am going to make him better in the future, but only if I have some more time. <br>
#### But what about the code quality?
The code of Dragonbot is absolutely horrible. It is really messy. I made it not really in an effective way. <br>
So the code could be much and much better, maybe I will make it better once, though only if I have more time. <br>
Time is a problem for me these days, so I don't know how long it will be before I do much on Dragonbot again. <br>
## Running your 'own' dragonbot
You can run your 'own' Dragonbot! <br>
It is not too difficult. Just fill out the things you need to fill out. <br>
Then you just make sure you have nodejs installed and the module 'discordjs'. <br>
And it is just simply running: 'node dragonbot.js' <br>
## Inviting the real Dragonbot to your own server
It is possible to invite Dragonbot to your own server, for that send me an email. <br>
